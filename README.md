# Various Python Scripts: main_code_file: [link](https://github.com/cloudarcKnights/python-scripting-project/blob/6b554bd163222d28d24b7eaea27e157fe22add95/test.py)

This repository includes multiple Python scripts that demonstrate different concepts and functionalities in Python programming language. Below is a brief summary of each script:

### 1. `lucky_number.py`
This script defines a name variable and calculates a lucky number based on the length of the name. The script then prints a message to display the name and the lucky number.

### 2. `list_operations.py`
This script performs various operations on a list of animals, including calculating the total number of characters, the average length of the animal names, and displaying the list with index numbers. It also defines a function that takes a list of people with their email addresses and returns their full email addresses in a list.

### 3. `multiples.py`
This script generates a list of multiples of a given number using both a for loop and a list comprehension.

### 4. `string_lengths.py`
This script uses a list comprehension to calculate the length of each string in a list of programming languages.

### 5. `odd_numbers.py`
This script defines a function that returns a list of odd numbers up to a given number.

### 6. `list_elements.py`
This script defines a function that takes a list name and a list of elements and returns a string that lists all the elements of the list.

### 7. `dictionary_operations.py`
This script performs various operations on a dictionary, including checking if a key exists, adding and deleting a key, iterating over the keys and values, and getting the keys of the dictionary.

### 8. `count_letters.py`
This script defines a function that takes a string and returns a dictionary with the count of each letter in the string.

### 9. `sum_server_use_time.py`
This script defines a function that takes a dictionary of server usage times and returns the total use time.

### 10. `setup_guests.py`
This script defines a function that takes a dictionary of guest names and the number of people in their party and returns a new dictionary with the same names as keys and the initial value of 0.

### 11. `python_script_creator.py`
This script defines a function that creates a new Python script and returns the size of the file.

### 12. `new_directory.py`
This script defines a function that creates a new directory and file inside it, and returns the list of files in the new directory.

### 13. `file_date.py`
This script defines a function that takes a filename and returns the date the file was last modified in the format "yyyy-mm-dd".

### 14. `parent_directory.py`
This script defines a function that returns the absolute path of the parent directory of the current working directory.

### 15. `csv_operations.py`
This script demonstrates how to read and write CSV files using Python's built-in csv module. It defines a list of dictionaries representing users and writes it to a CSV file. It also reads the CSV file and prints the user information.

## Description

This code demonstrates various programming concepts in Python.

### Block 1

The first block of code creates a variable called `name`, calculates a number based on the length of the name, and prints a formatted string using those variables. It also contains a list of animals and uses a loop to calculate the total number of characters in the list and the average length of the items.

### Block 2

The second block of code contains a list of `winners` and uses a loop to print out the list with index numbers. It also defines a function `full_emails()` that takes a list of tuples containing email addresses and names, formats them into full email addresses and returns a list of those email addresses.

### Block 3

The third block of code creates a list of multiples of 7 in two different ways. It also creates a list of languages and uses a list comprehension to calculate the length of each item in the list. The last part of the block creates a list of numbers that are divisible by 3 between 0 and 100.

### Block 4

The fourth block of code contains two functions. `odd_numbers(n)` takes an integer `n` and returns a list of all odd numbers from 1 to `n`. `list_elements(list_name, elements)` takes a string `list_name` and a list `elements`, and returns a formatted string that lists all the elements in the list.

### Block 5

The fifth block of code demonstrates the use of dictionaries. It creates a dictionary called `file_counts` that contains the number of files of each type in a folder. It then shows how to check if a key exists in the dictionary, add a new key-value pair, delete a key-value pair, iterate through the dictionary and access its keys.

### Block 6

The sixth block of code defines a function `count_letters(text)` that takes a string `text` and returns a dictionary that contains the count of each letter in the string. It also contains a function `sum_server_use_time(Server)` that takes a dictionary `Server` containing the amount of time each end user spent on a file server and returns the total use time rounded to two decimal places.

### Block 7

The seventh block of code defines a function `setup_guests(guest_list)` that takes a dictionary `guest_list` and returns a new dictionary with each guest from the input dictionary as a key and an initial value of 0.

### Block 8

The eighth block of code demonstrates file I/O and working with directories. It shows how to create a new file in a specified directory and return the list of files in that directory.

### Block 9

The ninth block of code uses the `os` and `datetime` modules to create a file in the current directory and return the date that the file was last modified.

### Block 10

The final block of code demonstrates how to get the absolute path of the parent directory of the current working directory, using the `os` module.

Overall, this code showcases a variety of programming concepts and techniques that are commonly used in Python programming.
